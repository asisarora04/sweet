CS 207 PROJECT

BLUETOOTH CONTROL CAR
This project is a bluetooth controlled car which is controlled using app on andriod phone. Project motivation came when one of our team memberâ€™s brother was very much into mobile phone games and we wanted him to be more practical and give him a sense of connecting to the real world. So we came up with a real life application in which we though of connecting a self-made car with mobile phone and have fun with it.
