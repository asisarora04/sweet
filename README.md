PROJECT CS207
In this paper we describe a modification of a Bluetooth Controlled Car with Arduino UNO. The original project, developed by Vishal Soni on hackster.io, describes a car that is controlled by mobile using Bluetooth. This car is loaded with some extra features which are controlled with various sensors. Such as Music, lights, fan and a start-stop button .
Novel Contribution
We aim to replicate the functionality of the original project with the addition of “music system, automatic lights and fan” these will provide a variety of music as well as automatic lights which turns on when it is dark and a temperature sensing fan which turns automatically when it is hot. For this, we propose the addition of music buzzer for music, temperature sensor for automatic fan and photoresistor for automatic lights which requires a button touch from the user to start the car.
Motivation
This Project motivation came when one of our team member’s brother was very much into mobile phone games and we wanted him to be more practical and give him a sense of connecting to the real world. So we came up with a real life application in which we though of connecting a self-made car with mobile phone and have fun with it.
Materials Required
According to the project website, the following materials are required:
-	Arduino UNO
-	Power Bank
-	LED Strips
-	Motor shield
-	HC – 05 Bluetooth module
-	Robot chassis
In addition, the following materials are required:
-	Temperature sensor
-	Photo resistor
-	Piezo buzzer

There were not many set-backs as we are quite competent when it comes to electronics. 
Team Roles
Being the part of the team we allotted different roles to each other depending on our capabilities. 
•	Gurasis Singh being a good writer has the responsibility of documentation. 
•	Noordeep Singh being a good programmer has the responsibility to write code. 
•	Finally, Himanshu Sharma having good sense of electronics has the role to wire everything up.
Summary
This project is all about the making and working of the Bluetooth controlled car. The car is having all automatic features set in it as like modern cars. The addition of the sensors is the main modification in order to make the new features work properly.
