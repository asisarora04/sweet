/* Libraries included: AFMOTOR.h

   Af motor library  means adafruit motor library which gives us the flexibility of the code. This makes the code a lot more easier and important things that are
   included in the library are inbuilt functions like:
   run, forward, backward, set speed and others.
   This makes the code loosely coupled and gives flexibility over editing. We can set the particular wheels that are in operation and edit the code accordingly.
/*
   Header: The final project consists of a bluetooth controlled arduino car along with other sensors. With the same code the car can be controlled manually and
   automatically with the Bluetooth RC controller app. The code can be used to control the can manually like when we open the serial monitor we can type the command like
   "F" for forward , "B" for backward, "R" for right, "L" for left and "s" for stop, after putting the command we can press send and it will obey the command.
*/

/*
   So for manual reading we have chosen character "bt" it reads the instructions from the serial monitor.
     we choose 1KHZ (AF_DCMotor motor3(3,MOTOR34_1KHZ) because we are using a regular battery for power source but if we use wired power source then we can use 64kHZ
     The frequency only used  is 9600 and also for serial monitor it should be same. we faced this minor problem.
     Rest of the code is simple when connected with app then pressing the button gives the instructions to the serial monitor and then it obey the instructions. Each
     instruction for specific output.
